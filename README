id3tool: a program for manipulating mp3 ID3 Tags

Using id3tool:
--==========--
id3tool should be fairly straight forward.

run it with "-h" to get usage.

no flags, with a filename prints the tags

--set-blah flags with a filename sets the ID3 tag

id3tool now also has a manpage [a really dodgey one yes, but a
manpage].  If somebody volunteers to write a better manpage, I will
consider whatever is produced.

History:
--====--
id3tool was written as a test program for a small id3 stub I'd written
for the "Ultimate MP3 Player" which is still a concept, and no code ;)
Having made a useful tool for setting ID3 tags [I hate GUI tag
editors] I decided I might as well tidy it up and release it.

The ID3 tag stub was originally written under windows, using ANSI C,
and copied over to linux where it worked perfectly first time. [yay!]

id3.c can still be ripped out of id3tool to provide id3 tag
manipulaiton functionality for other programs under the terms of the
BSD License.

Originally, I wasn't going to have any Win32 support, but somebody
submitted a patch - so I've incorporated it with some `corrections'.

ID3tool became available under the BSD license with 1.2.

The Future of id3tool:
--==================--
id3tool has reached the end of its development - I no longer have the
time to reinvent the wheel.

I will continue to patch the few bugs in id3tool as I find them.

Donations: 
--======-- 
If you want to make me feel all nice and fuzzy for writing this,
please send me Music CDs, especially anime soundtracks, or Anime
DVDs... I could always do with more of both. :) Email me
(xfire@xware.cx) for my current postal address.

Alternatively, you could do the Samba thing, and buy me some Pizza ;)

Copyright/License Blurb:
--====================--

id3tool is released under the modified BSD license.  Read COPYING
for details.

Happy Hacking.
