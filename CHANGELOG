1.0a
*	Initial version
*	didn't get published cause I was too lazy to be bothered copying from
	my home system to my work system.

1.0b
*	Finished id3 style tagging code with textual descriptions
	and set commands.

1.0c
*	re-fixed that bug [code base split by accident!]
*	tidyed up id3tool.c a bit [It was a bit too kludgish]
*	changed those C++ comments [// blah] that I'm sure was pissing off a 
	few people to C comments [/* blah */]
*	Tested on:
	*	i386/linux [OK]
	*	sparc/linux [OK]
*	Revised README file.

1.1a
*	Debian control files
*	autoconf/automake control files 
	[got sick of hand kludging the makefile]
*	New distro site [kitsumi.nethack.net is not under my control at the 
	moment :(]

1.1b
*	Fixed package to include missing files *d'oh!*

1.1c
*	Merged Win32 patches from Steve Kemp <skx@tardis.ed.ac.uk>.
	Patches were NOT acceptible in base form, and some files were modified.
*	Proper Win32 Makefile made.
*	Patched configure scripts to check for getopt dependancies now.
	[In recognition that some psuedo-unixes mightn't have getopt]
*	Patched original getopt.c file so it #ifndef's itself out if
	GETOPT_LONG is already availible. - I assume getopt.[ch] are
	from the GNU C Library, but steve didn't specify.

1.1d 
* 	Corrected tag replace bug (tags were always being appended, rather
	than replaced). Very sorry to those affected.  yet again, this
	one was a one character fix :/
*	Tested on:
	*	i386/linux [OK]
	*	ix86/win32 (Visual C 6) [OK]
*	Fixed rampantly incorrect email addresses in the documentation.
*	Fixed bug where if multiple file names were specified, only
	the files with tags before the first file without one had their
	ID3 tags displayed.
*	Fixed Win32 version to link in setargv.obj, so file globbing works as
	expected.

1.1e
*	"Yet Another Bugfix" release.  This focus'd on a bug where
	tag reading behaved a little "wierdly" because of files < 128 bytes.
	This is now fixed.
*	THIS IS THE LAST 1.1 RELEASE I WANT TO DO.
	Hopefully the pre-2.0's might start appearing really soon.

1.1f
*	Updated all email addresses to be correct [now that xware.cx exists]
*	"Yet Another Bugfix" release.  *sigh*.
	This time its a weirdness in RedHat where they don't support the
	negative seek offset via fseek.  
*	Fixed a one number `braino' when I knew I should have put a `1' 
	instead of a `128', but didn't.
1.2
*	v1.1 support to stop people from sending me bugreports from broken
	id3v1.1 support patch somebody did. (may they burn in hell).
*	Webspace address change.
*	Remove GNU Getopt.  Replace with NetBSD getopt.
*	License Change.  id3tool 1.2 is now BSD licensed.

1.2a
*	fixed broken getopt string (should close debian bug #280180)
*	fixed broken header reference (was annoying non-linux users)
*	Actually tested win32 build this time
*	fixed word wrapping in copyright notice.
