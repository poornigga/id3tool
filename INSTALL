INSTALL

Installation instructions for id3tool (Unixes & Psuedo-Unixes)

id3tool is now a autoconf/automake package (since 1.1), so making
id3tool is now fairly foolproof.  It will not build with BSD make
though, so you will need GNU make.  Sorry!

1) run ./configure
2) run "make"
3) run "make install" as root.
4) bingo :)  You're done :) have fun labelling all your mp3s.

Installation instructions for id3tool on Win32

2) run "nmake all"
3) copy the resultant id3tool.exe into an appropriate directory.
